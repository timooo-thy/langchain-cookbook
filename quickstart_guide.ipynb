       "'TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds static typing to the language, making it easier to catch errors and bugs in the code during development. TypeScript also includes features such as interfaces, classes, and modules, which help organize and structure code in a more maintainable way.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of using TypeScript is that it allows developers to write cleaner and more scalable code, as the type system helps to enforce consistency and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors. Additionally, TypeScript code can be compiled into plain JavaScript, which means it can be run on any browser or platform that supports JavaScript.\\n\\nOverall, TypeScript is a popular choice for developers who want to take advantage of the benefits of static typing while still working within the familiar syntax and ecosystem of JavaScript.'"
