LangChain is a versatile framework designed for developing applications powered by language models (LMs), enabling context-aware and reasoning capabilities within your applications. It's structured to integrate LMs with various sources of context, such as prompt instructions, examples, or specific content, facilitating applications to reason and decide on actions based on the provided context​​.

The framework consists of several key components:

LangChain Libraries: These are available in both Python and JavaScript and provide interfaces, integrations, runtime environments, and implementations for chains and agents.
LangChain Templates: A collection of deployable reference architectures for diverse tasks.
LangServe: A tool for deploying LangChain chains as REST APIs.
LangSmith: A developer platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring chains​​.
Getting started with LangChain involves a few steps:

Installation: You need to install the LangChain package, set up your environment, and become familiar with security best practices for development.
Quickstart Guide: Following the quickstart guide helps you build your first LangChain application by demonstrating how to create retrieval chains. These chains utilize a vector store as a retriever to fetch relevant documents for a given query, which are then passed to a language model for answering or further processing​​.
LangChain supports a variety of modules, including Model I/O for interfacing with language models, Retrieval for working with application-specific data, and Agents for letting models decide on tool usage based on high-level directives​​. The documentation also covers the use of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), a declarative way to compose chains, making it easier to prototype and move applications to production​​.
